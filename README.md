## 📌 Project 1: Task Manager (File-Based)

A simple console-based Task Manager application built using Python fundamentals.

### 🔹 Features
- Add new tasks
- View all tasks
- Delete tasks
- Mark tasks as completed
- View completed tasks
- Data persistence using text files

### 🔹 Files Used
- Tasks.txt → stores active tasks
- EndTasks.txt → stores completed tasks

### 🔹 Concepts Used
- File handling
- Lists
- While loops
- Input validation
- Basic error handling

This project focuses on practicing **real-life file-based logic** using Python.
## 🐾 Project 2: Pet Hotel Management System (OOP)

A console-based Object-Oriented Python application for managing a Pet Hotel.

### 🔹 Features
- Register dogs and cats
- Assign pets to owners
- Manage hotel stays and pricing
- Renew pet stays
- Search pets and owners
- Delete pets
- Display all pets and owners

### 🔹 OOP Concepts Used
- Classes & Objects
- Inheritance
- Encapsulation (private attributes)
- Properties & setters
- Composition (Owner ↔ Pets)
- Modular programming

This project demonstrates how Python OOP can be used to build a **real-world system simulation**.
